## üìä Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared 47,000+ samples for modelling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selected and transformed features for optimal model performance.
- **Ensemble Model:** Built a Voting Classifier combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and KNN.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved over **90% accuracy**, outperforming baseline models by 59%.
- **Interactive Deployment:** Deployed using Gradio for easy use by frontline healthcare workers.

## üì• Download the Trained Model
The trained model file is available under the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Jayy268/Malnutrition-Risk-Prediction/releases/tag/v1.0).  
Download it and place it inside the `models/` folder before running the notebook or launching the Gradio app.
